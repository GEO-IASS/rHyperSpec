**rHyperSpec version 1.0 (2017-04-15) -- "Bear Peak"**

Copyright (C) 2017 Christine Laney under the MIT Licence

**rHyperSpec** is an R *shiny* application that imports, documents, analyzes, and visualizes hyperspectral data from the PPSystems Unispec DC instrument. This software contains a list of hyperspectral indices with references that may be modified. 

rHyperSpec uses the R package *packrat* to make sure that the software may be downloaded on any platform with R and will run properly using required package versions (generally older than what is currently available from CRAN). 

Valuable contributions have been made to rHyperSpec by Craig Tweedie (conceptual ideas and data), Sergio Vargas (data and testing), John Gamon (conceptual ideas), and Fred Huemmrich (conceptual ideas and spectral indices).
